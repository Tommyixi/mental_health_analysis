\section{Demographics}
The following section compares the ethnic diversity of the Fall 2016 undergraduates at the Univeristy of California, Berkeley (UCB) with the profile of survey participants who completed the ``Undergraduate Student Well-being Survey - 2016" (USWBS), as populated by the UCB.

This table was made to compare with the survey demographics, on the next page. Note: underrepresented groups are defined as African American, Chicano/Latino, and Native American/Alaska Native.

Note: ethnicities for participants was pre-populated via information on record with UCB prior to the survey being dispersed. Information in this table \textbf{does not} reflect individual responses on the USWBS part 7, demographic information.

An asterisk (*) in the Significance column represents a significant difference between individuals in the Fall 2016 undergraduate population at UCB and the convenience sample from USWBS."), include.rownames = FALSE)
@

Using an $\alpha$ level of .05, we observe that the population of Fall 2016 undergraduates at UCB is mostly sigificantly different from those who completed the USWBS. Significance was not reached within the ``Japanese" and ``Other Asian" categories. Thus, generalizing the following results to the undergraduate population of UCB may be unwise as the USWBS convenience sample appears to over-sample from underrepresented minority populations while under-sampling from the ``White" ethnic group.

\section{Descriptive statistics}
The following section provides a breakdown of each of the questions asked and how participants responded. The following proportions were derived \textbf{only from participants who answered at least question}. Thus, for all proceeding questions the N = 922 (i.e., all proportions can be multipled by 922 to obtain the counts for each answer).

Sections are broken down into the various survey subject areas: general living, academic life, sleeping and eating habits, mental well-being, sexual violece, and campus resources. The last column is always ``NA," which is the proportion of people who did not answer the question from the pool of people who answered at least one question.

\section{Inference}

The following tables denote, for each of the above sections, whether or not there is an association between ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or living status versus all of the questions in the previous sections. $\chi^2$ tests were done to assess significance of associations at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level. For example, in the table immediately below, there is an asterisk at ``I am confident about my financial situation" and "Ethnicity." This means there is a significant association between satisfaction of living conditions and ethicity. All p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the bonferroni correction.
